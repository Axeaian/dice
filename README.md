# dice

When the "Roll!" button is clicked, take the number of sides entered by the user in the input text box, generate a random number between 1 and the number of sides, and display it in the large div.

e.g. if the user enters `6` in the text box, generate a random number between `1` and `6`.

## Extension

- If the user clicks on "Roll!" when the text box is empty, show an `alert` with the message `Please enter a number of sides!`
- If the user clicks on "Roll!" when the number in the text box is `0`, negative or not a number, show an `alert` with the message `Please enter a valid number of sides!`
